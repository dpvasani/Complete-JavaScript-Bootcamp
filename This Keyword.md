# üîë `this` Keyword in JavaScript ‚Äì Full Guide

The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to an **object**, but the object it refers to depends on the **context of execution**.

>The `this` keyword is a special identifier that refers to the execution context of a function. Its value is not static‚Äîit is dynamically set depending on how and where a function is called.

## üåç `this` in Global Scope

* In **browsers**, `this` refers to the `window` object.
* In **Node.js**, `this` in the global module scope refers to `{}` (an empty object) because Node wraps each module in a closure.

```javascript
console.log(this); // Browser: window, Node.js: {}
```

‚úÖ In a browser, this refers to `window` object.
‚úÖ In Node.js, it refers to an empty object `{}` in modules.

---

## üîÅ `this` Inside a Function

### üö´ Non-strict Mode:
>If no context is explicitly provided, `this` defaults to the global object:

```javascript
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
show(); // üëâ window (global object)
```

### ‚úÖ Strict Mode:

```javascript
"use strict";
function show() {
  console.log(this);
}
show(); // üëâ undefined ‚ùó
```
>In `'use strict'`, JavaScript does **not** fall back to the global object; `this` becomes `undefined`.
> üí° **`this substitution`**: In **non-strict mode**, if `this` is `undefined` or `null`, it's substituted with the global object.
> üß† **According to MDN**: In strict mode, `this` is preserved as whatever value it was when entering the execution context.


---

## üß† `this` Depends on How a Function is Called

```javascript
function sayHi() {
  console.log(this);
}
sayHi();       // undefined in strict mode, window in non-strict
window.sayHi(); // window attached with window
```

---

## üß± `this` Inside an Object's Method

>When a function is called as a **method of an object**, `this` refers to that **object itself**.
```javascript
const obj = {
  a: 42,
  show: function () {
    console.log(this);    // üëâ obj
    console.log(this.a);  // üëâ 42
  }
};

obj.show();
```

> üß† In methods, `this` refers to the object *before the dot*.
> üìö **MDN Analogy**: The value of `this` is determined by the object **before the dot** used to call the function.

---

## üîÉ Difference: Function vs Method

| Type     | Description                                  |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Function | Independent, not tied to any object          |
| Method   | Function inside an object, called via object |

---

## ü§ù `call`, `apply`, and `bind` Methods


Used to **borrow or override `this` context**:

```javascript
const user1 = {
  firstName: "Akshay",
  lastName: "Saini",
  fullName: function () {
    console.log(this.firstName + " " + this.lastName);
  },
};

const user2 = {
  firstName: "Sachin",
  lastName: "Tendulkar"
};

// üìû call
user1.fullName.call(user2);  // Sachin Tendulkar

// üìù apply (array of args)
function greet(hometown) {
  console.log(this.firstName + " from " + hometown);
}
greet.apply(user2, ["Mumbai"]);

// üìå bind (returns a new function)
const greetUser2 = greet.bind(user2, "Pune");
greetUser2();  // Sachin from Pune
```
---

## ü§ù 6Ô∏è‚É£ Using `call()`, `apply()`, `bind()`

These methods allow you to **explicitly set the `this` context** of a function.

### üìû `call()`: calls a function with a given `this` and arguments:

```javascript
user1.fullName.call(user2);
```

### üìù `apply()`: same as `call` but takes arguments as an array:

```javascript
greet.apply(user2, ["Mumbai"]);
```

### üìå `bind()`: returns a **new function** with `this` permanently bound:

```javascript
const greetUser2 = greet.bind(user2, "Pune");
greetUser2(); // Sachin from Pune
```

> üìö **MDN Note**: `bind()` is ideal for event handlers or callback scenarios where you want to **lock in** a particular `this`.

---

## ‚û∞ `this` in Arrow Functions

Arrow functions do **not have their own `this`** ‚Äî they **inherit from their lexical (outer) scope**.

```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 100,
  arrowFunc: () => {
    console.log(this.value); // ‚ùå undefined (this = window/global)
  },
};
obj.arrowFunc();
```

> üìö **MDN Analogy**: The value of `this` is determined by the object **before the dot** used to call the function.
> When a function is called as a **method of an object**, `this` refers to that **object itself**.
>

---

## üîÑ `this` in Nested Arrow Functions

>Arrow functions **don‚Äôt have their own `this`**. Instead, they **inherit** `this` from their **lexical environment**‚Äîthe scope in which they were defined.
>Arrow functions nested within regular functions still inherit `this` from their enclosing context.
```javascript
const obj = {
  value: 100,
  method: function () {
    const arrow = () => {
      console.log(this.value); // ‚úÖ 100
    };
    arrow();
  },
};
obj.method();
```

‚úÖ In this case, `this` refers to `obj` because `arrow` inherits `this` from the regular function.

---

## üñ±Ô∏è `this` in DOM Elements
>In DOM event handlers, `this` refers to the **element** that received the event.
> üìö **MDN Insight**: Event handlers receive the DOM element they‚Äôre bound to as `this`. Arrow functions should be avoided if `this` is needed.

```html
<button onclick="console.log(this)">Click Me</button>
```

‚úÖ Here, `this` refers to the **DOM element** that received the event.

---

## üèóÔ∏è `this` in Class Constructor

>In a class, the constructor and methods have their own context‚Äî`this` refers to the **instance** created by `new`.
> üìö **MDN Clarification**: `this` inside class constructors refers to the instance of the class being constructed.


```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name}`);
  }
}

const p = new Person("Darshan");
p.sayHello(); // Hi, I'm Darshan
```

‚úÖ In class constructors, `this` refers to the **newly created object** (i.e., the instance).

| Precedence | Context             | Takes Effect |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ |
| 1Ô∏è‚É£        | `bind()`            | Highest      |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£        | `call()`, `apply()` | Moderate     |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£        | Object Method       | Normal       |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£        | Global/Function     | Lowest       |

## üìù Final Notes

* `this` is **not a variable** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **keyword**.
* Arrow functions are great for **lexical scoping** but **not for dynamic binding**.
* `this` behaves differently in **Node.js vs Browser**, and in **strict vs non-strict mode**.
* Understanding how `this` works is crucial for mastering **object-oriented JS, DOM manipulation, and async programming**.

---

### üí° **JavaScript Runtime Environment**

JavaScript **doesn't run on its own** ‚Äî it runs **inside a JavaScript engine** provided by a **runtime environment** such as:

* **Browser (e.g., Chrome‚Äôs V8 engine)**
* **Node.js (server-side JS runtime using V8)**

---

### üåê **In Browsers:**

* The **global object** is `window`.
* It acts as the **global namespace** for all variables, functions, and objects.

```javascript
console.log(window); // Outputs the global window object in browser
```

‚úÖ Example:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a); // 10
```

---

### üñ•Ô∏è **In Node.js:**

* The **global object** is `global`, **not `window`**.
* Node uses its own module system, so variables are **not automatically added** to the global scope like in browsers.

```javascript
console.log(global); // Outputs global object in Node.js
```

‚úÖ Example:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(global.a); // undefined (NOT added to global scope)
```

---

### üîç **Summary Comparison Table:**

| Feature       | Browser                       | Node.js                                      |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime       | V8 inside Chrome/Firefox etc. | V8 inside Node.js                            |
| Global Object | `window`                      | `global`                                     |
| Global `this` | `this === window` is `true`   | `this === global` is `false` at module level |
| Global Scope  | `var` adds to `window`        | `var` stays inside module scope              |
| Modules       | Script files (global)         | CommonJS (`require`) or ESM (`import`)       |

---

### üìå Key Takeaway:

> **JavaScript behaves differently depending on the environment.**
> Browser exposes a `window` object as global, while **Node.js uses `global`** and encapsulates modules for better isolation and security.

---

## üß† Additional Concepts from MDN

### 1. `this` is not lexically scoped in regular functions

> In traditional functions, `this` is **not determined by where the function is defined**, but rather **how it's called**.

### 2. `this` in setTimeout or setInterval

```javascript
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log(this); // üëâ window (in browsers)
}, 1000);
```

> Use `bind(this)` or arrow functions if you want to preserve context.

---

## üåê Environment-Based Differences

### üåê In Browsers:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(window.a);     // 10
console.log(this === window); // true
```

### üñ•Ô∏è In Node.js:

```javascript
var a = 10;
console.log(global.a);     // undefined
console.log(this);         // {}
console.log(this === global); // false
```

> **MDN-like Summary**: In Node.js, the top-level `this` is not global, but **module-scoped**.

---

## üß© Final Key Takeaways

* `this` is **dynamic** in regular functions, **static** in arrow functions.
* Use `bind` to **lock** `this`, or arrow functions to **inherit** it.
* DOM elements get `this` when used with regular function event handlers.
* Node.js and browsers behave differently due to their respective **execution contexts**.
* **Understanding `this` is foundational** for writing reusable and bug-free JavaScript functions.

---
## Regular Function `This` Vs Arrow Function `This`

In JavaScript, `this` is a special keyword that refers to the **object that is executing the current function**.

* In **regular functions**, `this` is determined by **how** the function is called.
* In **arrow functions**, `this` is **lexically bound** ‚Äî it means they inherit `this` from the **surrounding (enclosing) code** where the function was defined.

---

## üí° Arrow Function and `this` Behavior

### üî∏ Regular Function vs Arrow Function ‚Äì `this` Example:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Darshan',
  regularFunction: function () {
    console.log("Regular:", this.name);
  },
  arrowFunction: () => {
    console.log("Arrow:", this.name);
  }
};

person.regularFunction(); // Regular: Darshan
person.arrowFunction();   // Arrow: undefined (or global object's name, in some environments)
```

### üîç Explanation:

* `regularFunction`: Here, `this` refers to the `person` object because it was called with `person.regularFunction()`.
* `arrowFunction`: Arrow functions **do not** bind their own `this`. Instead, they use the `this` from the **lexical context** ‚Äî the place where the arrow function was defined.
  In this case, it was defined inside the outer script scope, not inside the `person` object, so `this` doesn‚Äôt point to `person`.

---

## üß† What is **Lexical Context**?

> The **lexical context** is the environment where the function was **written** in code ‚Äî not where it was called.

Arrow functions don‚Äôt define their own `this`; they "close over" or **inherit `this` from their enclosing lexical scope**.

### Example with setTimeout:

```javascript
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;

  setInterval(function () {
    this.seconds++;
    console.log("Regular:", this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}

new Timer(); // NaN or undefined because `this` is NOT the Timer instance
```

üîÅ Fixed using an **arrow function**:

```javascript
function Timer() {
  this.seconds = 0;

  setInterval(() => {
    this.seconds++;
    console.log("Arrow:", this.seconds);
  }, 1000);
}

new Timer(); // Works correctly: logs 1, 2, 3...
```

### Why it works:

* The arrow function inside `setInterval` inherits `this` from the `Timer` function‚Äôs context ‚Äî which **does** refer to the new `Timer` instance.

| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Own `this` binding? | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No (inherits from lexical context)       |
