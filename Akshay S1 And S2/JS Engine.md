# 🎬 **Episode 16: JS Engine Exposed – Google's V8 Architecture**  

---

## 🌐 JavaScript is Everywhere!

> From **smartwatches ⌚**, **robots 🤖**, to **browsers 🌍** — JavaScript runs on everything thanks to the **JavaScript Runtime Environment (JRE)** 🛠️.

---

## 🧱 What is JRE (JavaScript Runtime Environment)?

🧃 Think of it as a **container** filled with everything needed to run JS code:

- ⚙️ **JS Engine** (core of JRE)
- 🌐 **Web APIs** to interact with the outside world
- 🔁 **Event Loop**
- 🧵 **Callback Queue**
- ⚡ **Microtask Queue**

👉 Browsers like Chrome 🧭 can run JS because they come with a built-in **JRE**.

---

## 📜 ECMAScript & JS Engines

🔖 **ECMAScript (ES)** is like the **constitution 📘** of JavaScript.

JS Engines follow ES rules. Some popular ones:

- 💠 **V8** – Chrome, Edge (by Google)
- 🌀 **SpiderMonkey** – Firefox (created by Brendan Eich himself!)
- 🔷 **Chakra** – Older versions of Edge (now deprecated)

---

## 🧠 What is a JavaScript Engine?

A **JS Engine** is **not hardware**, it’s a **program** written in **low-level languages (C/C++)** 🧬.  
It takes in **high-level JS code** and converts it into **machine code** 🧾⚙️.

---

## ⚙️ How JavaScript Code Runs Inside the Engine

JS execution goes through **3 core stages**:

---

### 🔍 1. **Parsing**

> Breaking code into understandable chunks for the engine.

📦 Example:
```js
let a = 7;
```
Becomes tokens:
- `let`, `a`, `=`, `7`

🧩 Then, the **Syntax Parser** converts these tokens into an **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)** 🌲  
🛠️ Use 👉 [AST Explorer](https://astexplorer.net) to visualize it.  
It’s like a `package.json` for your line of JS code.

---

### ⚙️ 2. **Compilation (JIT - Just-In-Time)**

> Combines benefits of interpreter 🗣️ and compiler 🧵

#### 🔁 Old days:
JS was only interpreted.

#### 🚀 Now:
JS is **JIT compiled**:
- 🔎 AST ➡️ Interpreter → creates **Bytecode**
- 🧠 **Compiler (TurboFan)** also works in parallel to optimize code
- 🧪 JS compiles **during execution**!

✔️ Yes, **JavaScript *does* compile!** ✅

---

### 🔥 3. **Execution**

> The moment JS code actually *runs* 🏃‍♂️

Needs:
- 🧠 **Memory Heap** – for storing variables, objects
- 📞 **Call Stack** – stack of function calls (from previous episodes)
- 🧹 **Garbage Collector** – uses **Mark & Sweep** ♻️ to free up unused memory

---

## 🛠️ V8 Architecture (Google’s JS Engine)

Google’s V8 is one of the **most powerful JS engines**, powering Chrome & Node.js 🚀

### 🧬 Components:

- 🔍 **Ignition** – Interpreter
- 🧵 **TurboFan** – Optimizing Compiler
- 🧹 **Orinoco** – Smart Garbage Collector

### 💡 Fun Fact:
> Different companies build different JS engines to **optimize performance**, but all must follow ECMAScript 📘 standards!
