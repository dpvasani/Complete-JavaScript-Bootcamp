## 🔹Using `.then()` (Without `async/await`)

### ✅ Code

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

function getData() {
  p.then((res) => console.log(res));
  console.log("JavaScript"); // This runs immediately
}

getData();
```

### 📤 Output

```
JavaScript
// (After 10 seconds...)
Resolved Value!!
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* The promise `p` is created and resolves after 10 seconds.
* `getData()` is called:

  * `.then()` attaches a callback to run when the promise resolves.
  * `console.log("JavaScript")` runs **immediately** — JavaScript doesn’t wait for the promise.
* After 10 seconds, the promise resolves and logs: `Resolved Value!!`.

---

## 🔹Using `async/await`

### ✅ Code

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

async function handlePromise() {
  const val = await p;
  console.log("Darshan Vasani");
  console.log(val);
}

handlePromise();
```

### 📤 Output

```
// (Waits 10 seconds silently...)
Darshan Vasani
Resolved Value!!
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* The promise `p` resolves after 10 seconds.
* `handlePromise()` is an **async function**.

  * `await p` pauses execution inside the function until the promise resolves.
* After 10 seconds:

  * It logs `"Darshan Vasani"`.
  * Then it logs the resolved value: `"Resolved Value!!"`.

## ⚖️ Key Differences Between `.then()` and `async/await`

| Feature                      | `.then()` (Old Way)                   | `async/await` (New Way)                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Syntax                       | Functional chaining                   | Looks like synchronous code                 |
| Readability                  | Can be harder with nested `.then()`   | More readable and structured                |
| Error Handling               | `.catch()` for errors                 | `try...catch` block                         |
| Execution Flow               | Continues immediately after `.then()` | Pauses at `await` inside the async function |
| Output Order (example above) | `"JavaScript"` first, then result     | Waits 10s, then `"Darshan Vasani"` + result |

---

## 🚀 Bonus: With Error Handling

### ✅ Using `.then().catch()`

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject("Something went wrong!");
  }, 5000);
});

function getData() {
  p.then((res) => console.log(res))
   .catch((err) => console.error(err));
}

getData();
```

### ✅ Using `async/await` + `try...catch`

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject("Something went wrong!");
  }, 5000);
});

async function handlePromise() {
  try {
    const val = await p;
    console.log(val);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

handlePromise();
```

---

## ✅ **Code**

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("Hello World");

  const val = await p;
  console.log("Darshan Vasani");
  console.log(val);
}

handlePromise();
```

---

## 📤 **Output**

```
Hello World
// (waits 10 seconds...)
Darshan Vasani
Resolved Value!!
```

---

## 🧠 **Explanation (Line-by-Line)**

1. **Promise Declaration (`p`)**
   A promise `p` is created. It will `resolve` with the string `"Resolved Value!!"` after **10 seconds**.

2. **`handlePromise()` Function Call**
   The `async` function `handlePromise()` is invoked.

3. **`console.log("Hello World")`**
   Immediately prints `"Hello World"` to the console. This line executes **synchronously**.

4. **`const val = await p;`**
   JavaScript **pauses execution inside `handlePromise`** at this line and waits for `p` to resolve (10 seconds delay).

5. **After 10 Seconds…**
   Once the promise resolves:

   * `val` is assigned `"Resolved Value!!"`
   * The function resumes execution.

6. **`console.log("Darshan Vasani")` and `console.log(val)`**
   These lines run after the delay:

   * First, `"Darshan Vasani"` is printed.
   * Then, `"Resolved Value!!"` is printed.

## ⏱️ Timeline Summary

| Time   | Console Output     |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| 0 sec  | `Hello World`      |
| 10 sec | `Darshan Vasani`   |
| 10 sec | `Resolved Value!!` |

## ✅ **Code with Detailed Logging and Context**

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()");
  console.log("👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.");

  const val1 = await p;
  console.log("✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.");
  console.log("🔁 Logging the first resolved value:");
  console.log("promise 1 time →", val1);

  console.log("🧠 Awaiting the same resolved Promise again — this should be instant.");
  const val2 = await p;
  console.log("✅ Second await returned immediately because Promise was already settled.");
  console.log("🔁 Logging the second resolved value:");
  console.log("promise 2 time →", val2);
}

handlePromise();
```

---

### 📤 **Output**

```
🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()
👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.
// (waits 10 seconds...)
✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.
🔁 Logging the first resolved value:

```

---

### 🧠 **Explanation of Code and Execution Flow**

#### 1. **Promise Creation**

* A **Promise `p`** is created, which will resolve with `"Resolved Value!!"` after **10 seconds**.

#### 2. **Calling `handlePromise()`**

* The function `handlePromise()` is executed. The first `console.log` statement `"🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()"` is logged immediately.

#### 3. **First `await p`**

* The code pauses at the first `await p` for **10 seconds**, as the Promise hasn't been resolved yet.
* Once the Promise resolves, the value `"Resolved Value!!"` is assigned to `val1`.
* `console.log("✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.")` and `"promise 1 time → Resolved Value!!"` are printed after the 10-second wait.

#### 4. **Second `await p`**

* The second `await p` is encountered, but **since the Promise is already resolved**, this `await` resolves immediately without waiting.
* This results in `"✅ Second await returned immediately because Promise was already settled."` and `"promise 2 time → Resolved Value!!"` being printed instantly.

---

### 🧠 **Detailed `console.log` Statements Explanation**

Each `console.log` in the code provides valuable insights into the execution flow:

* **🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()** — Marks the start of the function.
* **👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.** — Provides context that the first `await` is about to happen.
* **✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.** — Indicates that the promise has been resolved after the 10-second wait.
* **🔁 Logging the first resolved value:** — Clarifies that the first value is logged after resolving the Promise.
* **🧠 Awaiting the same resolved Promise again — this should be instant.** — Explains that the second `await` will resolve immediately since the promise is already settled.
* **✅ Second await returned immediately because Promise was already settled.** — Provides context that no delay happens this time.
* **🔁 Logging the second resolved value:** — Logs the second resolved value without delay.

---

### 🔄 **Key Insights**

* **Once a Promise is resolved**, any subsequent `await` on that Promise will return immediately without waiting for the delay.
* **Promises are resolved once** — subsequent calls to `await` on the same Promise will not cause a delay.

This structure helps in understanding **asynchronous behavior** and **Promise resolution**.

  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  }, 5000); // 5-second delay 
});

async function handlePromise() {

  console.log("✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved.");
  console.log("🔁 Logging the second resolved value:");
  console.log("promise 2 time →", val2);
}

### 📤 **Output**

```
🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()
👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.
// (waits 10 seconds...)
✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.
🔁 Logging the first resolved value:

🧠 Awaiting the second Promise (`p2`) — this should have a shorter delay.
// (waits 5 seconds...)
✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved.
🔁 Logging the second resolved value:

```

---

### 🧠 **Explanation of Code and Execution Flow**

#### 1. **Promise Creation**

* `p1` is a Promise that resolves after **10 seconds**.
* `p2` is a Promise that resolves after **5 seconds**.

#### 2. **Calling `handlePromise()`**

* The function `handlePromise()` is executed. The first `console.log` statement `"🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()"` is logged immediately.

#### 3. **First `await p1`**

* The code pauses at the first `await p1` for **10 seconds** because `p1` has a **10-second delay**.
* Once the Promise resolves, the value `"Resolved Value!!"` is assigned to `val1`.
* `"✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved."` and `"promise 1 time → Resolved Value!!"` are printed after the 10-second wait.

#### 4. **Second `await p2`**

* The second `await p2` is encountered and waits for the **5-second delay** of `p2` to resolve.
* Once `p2` resolves, the value `"Resolved Value!!"` is assigned to `val2`.
* `"✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved."` and `"promise 2 time → Resolved Value!!"` are printed after the 5-second wait.

### 🧠 **Detailed `console.log` Statements Explanation**

Each `console.log` in the code provides valuable insights into the execution flow:

* **🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()** — Marks the start of the function.
* **👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.** — Provides context that the first `await` is about to happen.
* **✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.** — Indicates that the first Promise (`p1`) has been resolved after waiting for 10 seconds.
* **🔁 Logging the first resolved value:** — Logs the value of `p1` after resolution.
* **🧠 Awaiting the second Promise (`p2`) — this should have a shorter delay.** — Explains that the second `await` will wait for the 5-second delay of `p2`.
* **✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved.** — Indicates that the second Promise (`p2`) has been resolved after 5 seconds.
* **🔁 Logging the second resolved value:** — Logs the value of `p2` after resolution.

---

### 🔄 **Key Insights**

* **Promises with different delays**:

  * `p1` and `p2` have different **resolve times** (10 seconds vs. 5 seconds). The second `await` will still wait for its respective Promise to resolve, causing sequential delays.
  * **Awaiting `p1` first** takes 10 seconds, then **awaiting `p2`** will take an additional 5 seconds.

* **Asynchronous Behavior**:

  * Each `await` pauses execution, waiting for the Promise to resolve before proceeding to the next line.
  * The **second `await` does not wait for the first Promise** to complete; it waits for **its own associated Promise** (`p2`).

# 👇✅ Real Behavior Great Observation



---

## ❓ **Ques)**

> For those who think:
>
> *"When the code reaches `await p1`, it suspends execution for 10 seconds. After that, it goes to `await p2`, where the timer starts (5 seconds), so the total time should be 15 seconds."*
>
> Is that true?

---

## ✅ **Answer)**

🧠 **No, that's a misunderstanding!**
The key thing to understand is:

> **⏰ The timer for a Promise starts when it's created, not when it's awaited.**

---

### 👇 Let’s break it down:

### 📦 Case 1: Promises Declared *Before* Async Function

```js
const p1 = new Promise(...setTimeout 10s);
const p2 = new Promise(...setTimeout 5s);

async function handlePromise() {
  await p1;
  await p2;
}
```

* ✅ `p1` and `p2` start **ticking immediately**, even before the function is called.
* ✅ `await p1` suspends execution, but **both promises are running in background**.
* ✅ By the time `await p2` is hit, `p2` may have **already finished** (because its timer started early).
* ⏱️ **Total execution time: \~10s**

---

### 🐢 Case 2: Promises Created *Inside* Async Function

```js
async function handlePromise() {
  const p1 = new Promise(...setTimeout 10s);
  const val1 = await p1;

  const p2 = new Promise(...setTimeout 5s);
  const val2 = await p2;
}
```

* ❌ `p1` starts only when function hits it.
* ❌ `p2` starts **only after** `await p1` completes.
* ⏱️ Total time = 10s + 5s = **15s**

---

## 🎯 Visual Timeline Comparison

### ✅ Case 1 (Parallel)

```
Time: 0s  → p1 starts, p2 starts
Time: 10s → p1 resolves, p2 already resolved
Total:     ✅ 10s
```

### ❌ Case 2 (Sequential)

```
Time: 0s  → p1 starts
Time: 10s → p1 resolves
Time: 10s → p2 starts
Time: 15s → p2 resolves
Total:     ❌ 15s
```

---

## 🧠 Final Takeaway:

> 🕰️ **Declaring a Promise = starting its timer.**
>
> 🛑 Awaiting a Promise = waiting for its result (but it doesn't start the timer).

---

## 🧠 Key Learning: `await ≠ start timer`

> **Declaring a Promise starts the timer, not the `await`.**
> `await` just pauses execution until the promise resolves.
>
> 🧪 So if both promises are declared upfront, they run **in parallel**, and total time = time of the slower one.
---
### ❓ Why does this **seem like** it's behaving *concurrently*, even though the `await`s are **sequential**?

Because both Promises `p1` and `p2` are **created before** the `async` function starts. Let's break it down:

---

### 🧠 Here's what's *actually* happening:

#### ✅ Step 1: **Promise Initialization**

```js
const p1 = new Promise(...) // starts the 10s timer immediately
const p2 = new Promise(...) // starts the 5s timer immediately
```

➡️ These Promises **start running their timers at the same time**, before `handlePromise()` even starts executing. That means:

* `p1` will resolve **10 seconds later**
* `p2` will resolve **5 seconds later**, regardless of when you `await` them

---

### 🧪 Execution Timeline (Real Behavior)

| Time | What Happens                                                                                             |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0s   | `p1` and `p2` are both created & timers start                                                            |
| 0s   | `handlePromise()` starts                                                                                 |
| 0s   | `await p1` → waits for remaining \~10s                                                                   |
| 10s  | `p1` resolves                                                                                            |
| 10s  | now `await p2` → `p2` has already resolved after 5s, so this resolves **instantly** (no additional wait) |
| 10s  | function completes                                                                                       |

So in effect, **you only wait 10 seconds total**, not 15 — because `p2` was *already resolved* while you were waiting on `p1`.

---

### 📌 Key Insight

> ❗ `await` pauses execution of the async function — but **it doesn't delay the start of the Promise**. Promises start running as soon as they are **constructed**.

---

### ✅ Want true sequential behavior (total wait = 15s)?

If you want `p2` to **start only after** `p1` completes, then you must create it *after* the first `await`:

```js
async function handlePromise() {
  const val1 = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved p1"), 10000);
  });

  const val2 = await new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved p2"), 5000);
  });

  console.log("val1:", val1);
  console.log("val2:", val2);
}
```

This way, the second Promise doesn’t even *exist* until the first one finishes.

---

### 🔁 Summary

* Your code is **sequentially awaiting** promises, but the Promises themselves are **concurrently executing** from the beginning.
* To get sequential behavior in **execution *and* start time**, you need to **construct the Promises after the awaits**, not before.

## ✅ Takeaway (in plain words)

> `await` **pauses** your async function, but it doesn’t delay the start of a Promise’s timer.
> Declaring the Promise triggers the timer **right away** — regardless of when you `await` it.

# Execution Flow

The execution flow of the provided code demonstrates how asynchronous JavaScript handles promises and `await` statements. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Promise Initialization**:
    - Both `p1` and `p2` are created immediately when the script runs.
    - Their timers (`setTimeout`) start counting down concurrently.

2. **Calling the Async Function**:
    - The `handlePromise()` function is invoked.
    - Initial `console.log` statements inside the function execute synchronously.

3. **First `await` (`p1`)**:
    - The function pauses at `await p1` and waits for `p1` to resolve.
    - Meanwhile, the timer for `p2` continues running in the background.

4. **Resuming After `p1`**:
    - After 10 seconds, `p1` resolves, and the function resumes execution.
    - The resolved value of `p1` is logged.

5. **Second `await` (`p2`)**:
    - The function encounters `await p2`.
    - Since `p2` started its timer earlier and resolves after 5 seconds, it has already resolved by this point.
    - The function resumes immediately without additional delay.

6. **Completion**:
    - The resolved value of `p2` is logged.
    - The function completes execution.

### Key Points:
- Promises start their timers when they are created, not when they are awaited.
- `await` pauses the function execution but does not block the entire script.
- If multiple promises are created upfront, their timers run concurrently, optimizing execution time.

const p1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 10000); // 10-second delay
});

const p2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { 
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve("Resolved Value!!");
  }, 5000); // 5-second delay 
});

async function handlePromise() {
  console.log("🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()");
  console.log("👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.");

  const val1 = await p1; 
  console.log("✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.");
  console.log("🔁 Logging the first resolved value:");
  console.log("promise 1 time →", val1);

  console.log("🧠 Awaiting the second Promise (`p2`) — this should have a shorter delay.");
  const val2 = await p2; 
  console.log("✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved.");
  console.log("🔁 Logging the second resolved value:");
  console.log("promise 2 time →", val2);
}

handlePromise();
console.log("👋 This log appears immediately after calling handlePromise() but before the first await is resolved.");
```

| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0ms     | `p1` and `p2` are created with `setTimeout()` running in background.                   |
| 1ms     | `handlePromise()` is called.                                                           |
| 2ms     | `console.log("🚀 Starting...")` and logs inside async function run.                    |
| 3ms     | `console.log("👉 Logging immediately...")` runs.                                       |
| 4ms     | First `await p1` suspends function execution.                                          |
| 5ms     | `console.log("👋 This log appears...")` runs immediately after `handlePromise()` call. |
| 10000ms | `p1` resolves after 10s. Execution resumes after first `await`.                        |
| 10001ms | Logs the first resolved value from `p1`.                                               |

| 15000ms | `p2` resolves after 5s, finishing by the time `await p2` is encountered.               |
| 15001ms | Logs the second resolved value from `p2`.                                              |

---

## 📦 **Call Stack & Event Loop Summary** :

1. **Call Stack**: Starts `handlePromise()` → hits `await p1` → suspends function execution.
2. **Timer Phase** (in Web APIs): `setTimeout`s for both promises start counting down concurrently.
3. **Callback Queue**: After 10 seconds, `p1` resolves and goes into the microtask queue.
4. **Re-entry**: Async function resumes with `val1`, then hits `await p2`.
5. Since `p2` started 5 seconds ago, it resolves **immediately** after the first `await` completes.
6. Logs all values and exits the function.

---

## 📤 **Output**:

```
🚀 Starting async function: handlePromise()
👉 Logging immediately before awaiting the Promise for the first time.
👋 This log appears immediately after calling handlePromise() but before the first await is resolved.
✅ First await completed. Promise has been resolved.
🔁 Logging the first resolved value:
promise 1 time → Resolved Value!!
🧠 Awaiting the second Promise (`p2`) — this should have a shorter delay.
✅ Second await completed. Promise has been resolved.
🔁 Logging the second resolved value:
promise 2 time → Resolved Value!!
```

---

## 🔎 **Key Learning Points**:

* **Timers start when promises are created**: `p1` starts the 10-second timer as soon as it's created, and `p2` starts the 5-second timer at the same time.
* **`await` does not delay promise execution**: The promises are already running in the background when the function hits the `await` statements.
* **Async behavior**: `await` suspends the async function but doesn't block the entire execution. Other code continues, like logging `"👋 This log appears immediately..."`.

---

### ❓ **Does `await` always return a Promise?**

✅ **`await` always returns the resolved value of a Promise**, **but it can be used with non-Promises too**. Here's what happens in both cases:

---

### 🔹 Case 1: `await` with a **Promise**

```javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved!"), 1000));

const result = await p;  // Waits for 1 second
console.log(result);     // Output: "Resolved!"
```

* `await` pauses execution until the Promise resolves.
* It returns the **resolved value** of the Promise.

---

### 🔹 Case 2: `await` with a **non-Promise (e.g., a string or number)**

```javascript
const result = await 42;
console.log(result); // Output: 42
```

* `await 42` is treated like `await Promise.resolve(42)`.
* So even if it's not a Promise, `await` **wraps it into a resolved Promise internally**.

---

### 🔴 Rejection case:

```javascript
await Promise.reject("Error!"); // throws immediately
```

* This will throw and should be wrapped in `try...catch`.

---

### ✅ Summary:

| What You Await      | How `await` Behaves                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A `Promise`         | Waits for it, returns resolved value or throws. |
| A non-Promise value | Converts to `Promise.resolve(value)`.           |
| A rejected Promise  | Throws the rejection error.                     |

---


## 🔍 **How `async/await` is Syntactic Sugar over `.then()` and `.catch()`**

### ✅ **The Core Idea:**

`async/await` doesn’t add new functionality to JavaScript — it's **just cleaner syntax** built on top of Promises.

> Think of `async/await` as a more readable and structured way to **write promise chains**.

---

### 🔁 **Example using `.then()` and `.catch()`**

```javascript
function getData() {
  return fetch('https://api.github.com/users/dpvasani')
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((data) => {
      console.log("User Data:", data);
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error("❌ Error fetching data:", error);
    });
}
```

---

### 🧠 **Same logic using `async/await`**

```javascript
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.github.com/users/dpvasani');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log("User Data:", data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("❌ Error fetching data:", error);
  }
}
```

---

### 🧬 Under the Hood:

* `await` **waits** for a Promise to resolve and **extracts the resolved value**.
* It’s equivalent to chaining `.then()` to get the resolved value.
* `try...catch` is used instead of `.catch()` for cleaner error handling.

---

### 🧾 Table Summary:

| Feature              | `.then().catch()`           | `async/await`                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Syntax Style         | Functional chaining         | Imperative (step-by-step)             |
| Error Handling       | `.catch()`                  | `try...catch`                         |
| Readability          | Harder with multiple chains | Easier and cleaner, looks synchronous |
| Underlying Mechanism | Uses Promises               | Uses Promises                         |

---

### ⚙️ Internally:

```javascript
async function foo() {
  const data = await fetch(...);
}
```

Is internally equivalent to:

```javascript
function foo() {
  return fetch(...).then(data => {
    return data;
  });
}
```

---

### ✅ TL;DR:

* `async/await` **does not replace** Promises — it **uses them**.
* It’s **syntactic sugar** for chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` — more readable and easier to follow, especially with multiple async operations.
