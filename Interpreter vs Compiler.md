|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| ⏱️ Execution         | Line-by-line, during runtime                 | Translates entire code before running           |

### 🤔 **So... is JavaScript Interpreted or Compiled?**

✅ **JavaScript is both!** — It’s a **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiled Language**.

---

### 🔥 What is JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation?

- JavaScript was originally **interpreted** 🗣️.
- But modern JS engines (like V8) use **JIT compilation** 🚀.
- Code is:
  1. Parsed 🔍
  2. Interpreted to bytecode by **Ignition** 🧠
  3. Then **TurboFan** compiles hot (frequently used) code into fast machine code ⚡

This means:
- JavaScript is **not strictly interpreted** anymore.
- It’s a **hybrid** – interpreted *and* compiled during execution. 💡

---

### 🧵 Final Verdict:

> **JavaScript is a dynamic, high-level, interpreted language that is now JIT-compiled thanks to modern engines like V8.** ✅

---

## 🔍 **Example: Sum of Two Numbers**

### 🟨 JavaScript (Interpreted + JIT Compiled)

```javascript
// JavaScript code
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

console.log(sum(5, 3)); // Output: 8
```

### ⚙️ What happens?
1. 🔍 **Parsing** → Code is tokenized and converted to AST.
2. 🔄 **Interpreted by Ignition** to bytecode.
3. 🚀 **Optimized by TurboFan** during runtime if the function is called often.
4. 🧠 Executed on the **Call Stack**, using the **Memory Heap** if needed.

✅ You can run it **immediately** in browser or Node.js — no compilation step required by the user!

---

### 🟦 C++ (Fully Compiled Language)

```cpp
// C++ code
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << sum(5, 3) << endl; // Output: 8
    return 0;
}
```

### ⚙️ What happens?
1. 🧾 You must **compile** it first using a compiler (like g++):

   ```bash
   g++ sum.cpp -o sum
   ./sum
   ```

2. 🔍 Entire code is converted into **machine code before execution**.
3. 🚀 Executed as a native binary, extremely fast.

✅ Cannot run without explicit compilation step.

| 🚀 Performance         | Fast (after optimization)                 | Very fast (native machine code)            |

## 🧠🚀 Compilation Phase Optimizations in JavaScript Engines (like V8)

During **JIT Compilation** (Just-In-Time), the JS engine tries to generate the most efficient machine code. Here are the major optimizations it performs:

---

### 1. ✅ **Inline Caching** 🧠⚡  
Speeds up repeated property accesses by remembering the location (shape) of properties in objects.

```javascript
const user = { name: "Darshan" };
console.log(user.name); // Access is cached!
```

🔁 V8 stores the “map” of the object, so next time it doesn’t look it up from scratch.

---

### 2. 📥 **Function Inlining**  
Inserts the function body directly where it is called — avoids the cost of calling functions repeatedly.

```javascript
function square(x) {
  return x * x;
}
console.log(square(5)); // May be replaced directly with 25
```

🚀 Great for small, frequently used functions!

---

### 3. 💀 **Dead Code Elimination**  
Removes code that will never run.

```javascript
if (false) {
  console.log("Unreachable"); // removed at compile time
}
```

♻️ Reduces final code size & runtime overhead.

---

### 4. 🧮 **Constant Folding**  
Evaluates constant expressions at compile time.

```javascript
const total = 10 * 2; // computed during compilation
```

📦 Saves runtime CPU cycles by replacing with `20`.

---

### 5. 🔁 **Loop Unrolling**  
Reduces overhead of loop iteration by expanding the loop manually if number of iterations is known.

```javascript
// Instead of this:
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) console.log(i);

// This might be compiled into:
console.log(0); console.log(1); console.log(2);
```

🌀 Improves performance by reducing control flow logic.

---

### 6. 🧪 **Type Feedback & Speculative Optimization**  
JS is dynamically typed, so V8 guesses types during runtime and optimizes accordingly.

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return "Hello " + name;
}
greet("Darshan"); // optimized
greet(42);        // causes deoptimization
```

🧠 It speculates based on past behavior, and if wrong, the code is *deoptimized* (slowed back down).

---

### 7. 🏃 **Escape Analysis**  
Determines if an object can be safely placed on the **stack** instead of the **heap**.

```javascript
function createPoint(x, y) {
  return { x, y }; // Optimized if not used elsewhere
}
```

📦 Avoids expensive heap allocations & garbage collection.

---

### 8. 📤 **Copy Elision** (a newer addition!)  
Avoids unnecessary copying of objects during returns or assignments by **reusing** memory or skipping copy steps.

```javascript
function getUser() {
  const user = { name: "Darshan" };
  return user; // May avoid copying!
}
```

🧼 Improves memory usage by avoiding temporary object duplication.

---

### 9. 🧹 **Garbage Collection Awareness**  
Although not a direct optimization, JS engines optimize around **GC behavior** — such as delaying allocation or reusing freed memory smartly.
